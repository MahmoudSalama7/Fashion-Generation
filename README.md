# Fashion-Generation
## Fashion Outfit Generation using Computer Vision, GAN, LSTM & Gemini
Project Overview
This project leverages advanced AI models to revolutionize the fashion industry by generating and recommending outfits. It consists of several parts:

Computer Vision Model: Classifies fashion images, retrieving style information.
Complementary Recommender System: Integrated with Gemini to suggest the missing outfit component.
DCGAN: Generates new fashion designs.
cGAN: Modifies existing outfit images, providing fresh alternatives.
NLP LSTM Model: Analyzes customer feedback in both English and Egyptian dialects, using pre-trained models with fine-tuning.
Features
Image Classification: Accurately classifies fashion styles.
Gemini Integration: Provides recommendations based on the userâ€™s outfit.
GAN-based Fashion Design: Generates and edits outfits.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses LSTM for multilingual customer feedback analysis.
How to Run:
Download the dataset.
Train the models using the provided code on Kaggle.
Input your images to generate recommendations and new fashion designs.
